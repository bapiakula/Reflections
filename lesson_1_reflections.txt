How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

it was pretty cool with the operator signs to know difference between new and old
But if the code if bigger. 
i think it will be tough

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Upfront if we have some bugs or we are lost in between, then this helps us a lot.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

pros

it is logical way and helps us to know when we did a major change to code

cons

sometimes commit may be too big or too small and we may miss


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

because git uses the concept repository where every file is saved


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log is used to know the id's
and git diff is used to know the difference between two commits like add, subtract
